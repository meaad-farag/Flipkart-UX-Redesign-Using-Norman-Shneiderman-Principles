## 🟦 Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules — Redesign

### 1. Consistency
- Menus on the homepage differ from menus on other pages in form, labels, and icon positions.  
- Icons for the cart and user profile also change placement across pages.  
 **Fix:** Unifying menu structure, labels, and icon positions across all pages.

### 2. Universal Availability
- No language options were available.  
 **Fix:** Added a language switch button with a flag icon in the header.

### 3. Good Quality Feedback
- “Add to Cart” button remains active even when a product is out of stock.  
 **Fix:** Button now shows “Out of Stock” when inventory is zero.

### 4. Process & Result-Oriented Dialogues
- No major violations found.

### 5. Failure Protection
- No major violations found.

### 6. Take Back Operations
- When viewing a product inside a category, there was no way to return to the same category.  
 **Fix:** Enabled functional back navigation to the previous category page.

### 7. Control Must Be in User
- The homepage had no scrollbar, preventing users from scrolling down.  
 **Fix:** Added a functional scrollbar.

### 8. Reduce Short-Term Memory Load
- Homepage was cluttered with ads, excessive product lists, and large text blocks.  
 **Fix:** Removed unnecessary content, reduced visual noise, and improved page organization.

##  Norman’s Six Design Principles — Redesign

### 1. Visibility
- Menus on inner pages expanded excessively and covered too much screen space.  
 **Fix:** Redesigned menus to match the clean and compact style of the homepage.

### 2. Affordance
- Offer section scroll arrows did not work, misleading the user.  
 **Fix:** Removed non-functional arrows since the offers already auto-scroll.

### 3. Mapping
- No major issues detected.

### 4. Feedback
- Same issue identified under Shneiderman (Add to Cart button).  
 **Fix:** Clear visual feedback added.

### 5. Constraint
- No problematic constraints found. System constraints like requiring login were appropriate.

### 6. Consistency
- Same consistency issues identified under Shneiderman.  
 **Fix:** Unified layouts, icons, and menu styles.
